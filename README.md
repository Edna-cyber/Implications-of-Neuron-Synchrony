# Implications of Neuron Synchrony

This is the repository for my Computer Science Graduation with Distinction senior thesis: "Implications of Input Neuronsâ€™ Spike Timing Synchrony for Neural Coding."

I created an artificial neural network that simulates the resting discharge properties of a real floccular target neuron recorded in vivo. My results indicate that the closest resemblance to the data from the real neuron occurs with zero synchrony of inhibitory inputs. I conclude that synchronous inhibitory inputs are not required to account for the firing of real target neurons recorded in vivo.
